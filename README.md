# Google Analytics Capstone
ANALYSIS OF CYCLISTIC, A FICTIONAL CHICAGO-BASED RIDE-SHARE COMPANY

A solo project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate

## Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago that launched in 2016. The bike-share program has more than 5,800 geo-tracked bicycles and 600 docking stations. Most of Cyclistic users ride for leisure, but some use them to commute to work each day. The company offers single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Users who use single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders, and those who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## Problem
Cyclistic finance analysts have found that annual members are more profitable than casual riders.

The company wants to understand how causal riders and annual members use their bikes differently in order to maximize the number of annual memberships through their new marketing strategy. Instead of targeting new customers, the company wants to convert casual riders into members.

# Business task: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
